# smartcontactmanager
I developed a Smart Contact Manager application using Spring Boot, Hibernate, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL.
This application efficiently manages contacts, allowing users to add, update, and delete contacts while showcasing a user-friendly interface.
By leveraging modern web technologies, I created an intuitive experience for users to manage their contacts seamlessly.
